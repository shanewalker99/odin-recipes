    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients</li>
        <li>Mix well by hand. The meat should look emulsified with all ingredients, not crumbly</li>

        <li>To cook, either sear and finish in a sauce of choice, or bake on a sprayed sheet-tray at 375 degrees F</li>
        <li>If unsure if meatballs are cooked, their internal temperature should be above 145 degrees F at least</li>
