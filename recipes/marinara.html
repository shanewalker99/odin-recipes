    <h2><u>Homemade marinara sauce, perfect to accompany any pasta!</u></h2>
    <p>This quick recipe is so simple, only using <b>6</b> ingredients. A no brainer, for sure</p>
    <p>Utilizing some beautiful San Marzano canned tomatoes, this sauce is sure to blow your socks off</p>
    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil - 2 Tbsp</li>
        <li>Garlic - 8 Cloves</li>
        <li>White/Yellow Onion - 1 Each</li>
        <li>San Marzano Tomatoes, Peeled - 28oz Can</li>
        <li>Salt - To Taste</li>
        <li>Basil - For Garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by mincing your garlic cloves, 'small' dicing your onion, and hand crushing your tomatoes. Mise en place, as the french call it</li>
        <li>Add your olive oil to a medium sized sauce pot, heat over medium low heat, and add your garlic</li>
        <li><em>Stir your garlic often</em>, as it will burn if you do not. Cook until a fragrant golden brown color comes about</li>
        <li>Add your onion into the pot. Stir to coat in oil, and season generously with salt to release water and break down the onion</li>
        <li>Again,<em> stir often</em>, so no burning occurs. Once translucent and soft, add your hand crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>This is where the magic happens. Let cook slowly for 30 minutes to upwards of an hour. The longer you cook, the more the flavors meld and grow</li>
        <li>Season to taste with salt, and it is now your choice to leave slightly chunky or puree for a smoother sauce</li>
        <li>Serve with pasta (or whatever else) of choice, garnish with fresh basil if you'd like</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
