    <h2><u>Handmade pasta, perfect to accompany any sauce of choice!</u></h2>
    <p>Nothing beats some handmade homemade pasta, fresh in taste and perfect in bite</p>
    <p>A little more effort than dried pasta, but you'll thank me later after experiencing FRESH!</p>
    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour (All-Purpose) - 16 oz, more for kneading/rolling pasta dough.</li>
        <li>Egg Yolks - 16 each</li>
        <li>Olive Oil - 1 Tbsp</li>
        <li>Salt - 1 1/2 Tsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in food processor. Blend until a rough ball forms</li>
        <li>Remove from food processor to a lightly floured work surface</li>
        <li>Knead until dough springs back to the touch, and is smooth but not sticky</li>
        <ul><li>Note that if its sticking to your surface, use a slight amount of flour to dust the ball</li></ul>
        <li>Cover the dough and let rest for 10-15 minutes to fully hydrate the flours and decrease elastisity</li>
        <li>Sheet through a pasta roller, or roll by hand to very thin layers</li>
        <li>Shape/cut to your favorite pasta shapes (Ravioli/Agnolotti are personal favorites with this dough)</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
